# Stock Analysis using VBA in Excel
  This VBA script Loops through the first column of the excel sheet. It determines if the stock ticker is differnet from the cell behind it and in front of it. If it finds a difference in tickers, it stores the relevent information to do calculations with. The script will then output the results of those calculations in the same worksheet. Lastly, it formats the results and loops through the next worksheet in the workbook.
